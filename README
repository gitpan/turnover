This package will allow multiple people to write entries into 
a logfile without overwriting each others entries - which can 
happen when an editor is used.

Description:
   turnover.pl - the actual turnover program
   archlogview.pl - the archived logfile viewer.


Configure:
   You will need to set the $pathprefix (towards the tops of these scripts) to the 
   path where the turnover directory is located.

Arguments:
   If a "-loc" argument is used, turnover will look in the current directory
   for the logfile "turnover.log"
